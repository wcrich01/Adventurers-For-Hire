            <h3>Our Role</h3>
            <p>Aquisitions Incorporated was founded by a group of like-minded individuals seeking to aide their communities and see the wider world. When the local government can't spare the manpower to deal with threats, you can count on us to step in and clear this menace. </p>
            <p>We also also beleive in helping out those seeking to protect themselves or adventures in need of gear, therefore, we opened a shop on in the heart of the market district of Summer Spring. We have a wide selection of merchandise for any adventurer.</p>

        <div>
            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>The group first meet when they all answered a wanted ad for adventurers to search out a missing expedition in the Greypeak Mountains. After a long series of adventures after finding the ransaked expeditionary fort, we defeated the hold of goblins and managed to free the few survivors of the expedition.</p>
            <p>Upon returning to Summer Spring, the group dealt with undead rising from the sewers at night. The group discovered this was the work of several vampires working out of building in the market district. The group received titles from the high coucil of the city and became minor nobility. The took over ownership of the now vacant building and turned it into the headquarters and store for Aquistions Incorporated.</p>
